**Example storyboard from 'I Wish' by Koreeda**

Most of the shots in the montage are static with limited movement. However the few that do, the movement lines indicate the direction. I also labelled a few revelvent visual aspects of the scenes such as the newspaper under the paint, as they are imperitive to the meaning of the shot but difficult to visually portray in the storyboard.

**Self-Portrait assesment storyboard**
My project is a montage where most of the shots are static and centred in the frame, hopefully maintaining enough visual similarity so that the cuts aren't jarring to a viewer. 
The project will start and end by the pushing of a power button, establishing that the piece takes place within the confines of a singular event or situation.

My project can roughly be divided into 5 small sections. I aim to maintain continuity through the transitions between these sections, via moving subjects out of frame (seen pg.1, frame 5) or maintaining momentum by following the movement of the previous shot (seen pg.4 frame 5/6) 
The main emotions I am trying to portray to the viewer are frustration and/or restlesness. The lingering shots of the fidgeting and the cutaway shots to the bin being filled up with papers juxtaposed with the colour coordinated shots of things that bring me joy.
