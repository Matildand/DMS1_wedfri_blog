**Shape Tool Tracing**

The shape tool was difficult to trace over as handpainted art has a very organic feel to it. To decide which shapes and sections I focused on, I focused on large chunks of colour. This resulted in light and shadows coming through, but not details like window sills and lettering on windows.

The pen tool was far easier to get a more accurate tracing of the painting, as I was able to create more organic shapes. This ability seemed to almost make it harder to identify which parts of highlights and shadows to replicate as there was no longer the barrier of shape to limit things for me. to overcome this, I tried to focus only on the colours that were used to imply a third dimention.
