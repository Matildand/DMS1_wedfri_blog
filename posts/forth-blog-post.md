**Key Moment - Audio**
The key moment of my project is when the shots switch between the pencil, keyboard, and mouse. I am planning to utilise sound in this moment to enforce the emotional climax by layering the sounds of the pencil scratching and clicks of the keyboard and mouse building up until the resolution of hitting the enter button. 
The overlapping audio will provide a sense of unity between the shots, implying that they are happening simultaneously or within rapid succession.

**Assignment draft**

After creating the storyboard, I started by filming some of the easier shots first to get back into the swing of framing and composing a shot. I had some issues with a few of the birdseye veiw shots where my phone camera recorded them in portrait which caused me to have to reshoot a few things. 
The editing process in the draft is pretty simple so far, I just inserted all the shots in the correct order and did a rough edit of them to match up better with the audio track I found on the youtube audio library.
