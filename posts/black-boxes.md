![black square activity](/static/w06s1/squares.png)
I used the rectangle shape tool to create my first black square and mostly used the select tool from then on to resize and rotate the squares as I saw fit. To ensure that the shape remained a square whenever I increased or decreased the size I made sure to hold shift on my keyboard to lock in the dimentions. I also copy and pasted the square, rather than draw a new one each time. I also move the grey border layer above the squares to make it easier to see the designs within the boxes as it covered the overhang from the squares. 
In the end as I was picking my favourites I realised that the boxes were too close together to properly hide the overhang for my tension example, so I used the shape builder tool to seperate the part of the square that was overlapping the box next to it and removed it without shanging the original design.
