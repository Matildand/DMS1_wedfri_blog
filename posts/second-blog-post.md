Below is a 30 second clip i recorded of an important physical space to me. It is of a corner of my backyard, this space is important to me as it reminds me of each of the members of my family.

Me and Airiel shared the clips that we recorded, this is how I edited them together.

It was fairly difficult to find a way to blend the clips together in a meaningful way as they were so different. Mine was almost constantly in motion, whereas Airiel's was stagnent. Eventually I chose to embrace the movement of my recording, and rapidly cut between sections to further emphasis the juxtoposition against the quiet stillness at the end. 
To further create a dichotomy between the two spaces, I switched the audio of the clips so the high pace shots would have a louder wind noise that would make the cuts between them more jarring. This also allowed the final clip to have subtle chimes that can be heard in the background
