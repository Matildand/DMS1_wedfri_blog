**12 Column Layout**

I adjusted the frame to fit into a 12 column layout. It was a bit difficult to do whilst still maintaining the more organic aesthetic style so some aspects don't completely line up, however I still think it did help the text especially to look intentional and clean.

**Contrast**

Using the contrast checker I discovered that many of the colours I was using were too similar. Depending on the type of object or text i was checking i adjusted the colours to make sure they passed. I was surprised just how different the colours had to be, especially for small text, it felt like I almost had to make it all black and white.

This is how the frame looked overall after adjusting all the colours.

**Developement So Far**

In terms of how the webpage looks now compared to the original wire frame, I think that it is mostly pretty similar. I have added colour and more design aspects like the flowers and the plant pot, as well as more vines at the top to help lead the eye down the page. I think originally I thought I would have more writing explaining each of the assignments, but I have had to reframe my perspective of only having a very short description for each.
