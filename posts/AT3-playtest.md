The video is my friend Nadhira playing through the environment for the first time, she had no context for what I was sending her so her exploration is very random. I put the footage on 2x speed because there were lots of times when she was standing still and asking me questions I wouldn't answer. From this session I discovered that the path is very clear in the first half, but she seemed to get confused or lost once she entered the second half of the terrain. To help combat this I am going to attempt to create more interest in the path beyond the campfire so the player instinctively knows where to go next. I also noticed she was struggling with the mouse sensitivity, so I'm going to lower it to a more manageable level. I also need to add walls around the terrain so people aren't tempted to jump off.
