**Theme: Community**

**Platform: Library Website**

**Context: The books are categorised by genre, allowing readers to be able to find books they are interested in**

**Intended Audience: Retirees and Children**

Before completing the 45 thumbnails homework task, I decided on my nine book genres that I would be representing. I aimed to cover a wide array of genres, with both fiction and nonfiction, that were different enough from each other that they wouldn't overlap.

I found that the hardest genres to think of designs for were either too specific or too broad. Specific genres like graphic novels gave me very little room to think of a wide variety of icons as there were very limited visual associations I could draw on. Whereas broad genres like picture books have too many associations connected to them which caused any icons I drew to feel limiting as they couldnt accurately represent the entire genre. 

At this point I also decided that I wanted to have different background shapes for each main category of icons (fiction, non-fiction, and childrens)

For the colour homework I transferred a few of my favourite icons from the thumbnail sketches into illustrator. Throughout this process I found that I preferred when the shapes didn't have outlines as I was regularly resizing them which made it hard to maintain a constant ratio. 

**This was my first iteration in illustrator so it was a lot of trial and error to find a style I was happy with.**

These are iterations of the icons I was least happy with in the colour exercise, and ones I hadn't made in illustrator yet. My main purpose of these was to try a few other image options to help decide which ones translate the best into an icon and to see which ones complement each other the best. 
These icons are also more complicated and colourful than ideal for an icon, but I found it easier to get the ideas down in this style to then compact down later on.

These are the first iterations of the simplified version of my icons. At this point I had finalised which design I wanted for each genre and a very rough colour palette that helps to link all the icons together. I felt the more streamlined design was better for my target audiences as elderly people often have limited vision so the clearer and simpler I make the icons the more accessible they are. In later iterations I also change the colour palette to be brighter, to help appeal to children.

At this point I had started to try and build my website on VS code. I had a lot of issues in setting up the repository, but eventually I managed to set it up correctly. 
My repository went through many changes as I tried to efficiently organise my files and script into a way that was clear and actually functioned. I ended up numbering all the files correspoding with their location on the website, which made it clearer for to understand in the typing of the interaction code.

After seeing the icons on the webpage I felt that they appeared dull as there wasnâ€™t enough contrast between the colours and the black. this lead me to change the colour palette to be brighter and switch the black to white.

I also started to plan out the alternate icon state. my top two ideas were to either invert the colours or fill in the white with a darker tone of the background colour. I preferred the inverted version but felt the white background was too empty. I resolved this issue by adding an internal border around the background to maintain the shape and size. 

**SOund effects**
Each of my sound effects were ideally to thematically match the book genre of the icon they are associated with. 
I found most of them through either the youtube audio library or Freesound (Attributions at the end). I did record my own sound effect for the biography icon using voice memos on my phone. 
I had trouble with the sounds being too loud and going into the red so I lowered the dB on Audition. 
Making sure the sound effects were the right length was also difficult, but after some trial and error I found that around 4 seconds seemed to work for the longer sounds to still be snappy but without interfearing with the effect of the sound. 

**Website Background**
For the background, I initially made a brown textured background in illustrator as a rough draft to see how it would look behind the icons on the website, but ultimatly I decided to use Photoshop to create a wood-like design to fit with the library theme.
