**Assignment 1 - Video Edit** 
How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of your edit? 

*Clips lining up to the beat of the song, occasionally half time. Overlapping audio to make frantic feelings like things were happening simultaneously. Music choice that helped reflect my personality and interests*

How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?

*I think if i had put more thought and effort into actually filming the footage for the project it would have looked better. I basically planned out each individual shot of my video in storyboards and filmed those directly, as I knew that if I didn't plan it out to the second I would have no idea what to record.*

What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how did you apply this knowledge to your project?

*Through sincresis sound can help make a video feel real by adding context to the background. The build in the music also contributed to a rise in tension.*

How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project? 

*I kept the pacing and rhythm of my clips very consistent throughout the project, slowly becoming more rapid as the video reaches its climax.* 

Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to depict in your portrait?

*I depicted some of my interests in other creative outlets like makeup and crochet. As well as some of my struggles in thinking of ideas and expressing myself*

What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your work? 

*I tried to make all of the more personal aspects pink as a subtle way of representing myself, the continuous close up shots helped to convey a feeling of confinement.*

**Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons**

How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose the theme that you did? 

*I made icons for an online library, the icons represented different genres. I picked community as a theme, and felt libraries fitted it as they are public services/council run. I thought it would be nice to make something for a free and accessible place. I also wanted to make icons for things that didn't already exist, so it would be easier to think of my own interpretations.*

Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with? 

*I started making the icons as I felt looked nice, not worrying about simplicity or icons specifically to help me get the ideas in the program. This allowed me to make up to three alternate designs for each icon and see how they looked in the geometric style. I then further iterated them by simplifying them and matching them up with ideas that matched visually or with running themes.*

How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator? Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?

*I started by translating them directly by tracing over the sketches in illustrator. Through this process and the following iterations, lots of the detail was lost. I found that the best icons had a good balance of being simple enough that the design wasn't lost through simplification while also maintaining identifiable aspects*

How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why did you choose the palette that you did? 

*I used three colours across my icons, while each only contained one. The colours that I chose were consistent in tone and brightness to help maintain the unity between them. The specific colours were chosen as they needed to appeal to a wide range of demographics, I felt I should avoid colours closely associated with a specific group of people. They also all contrasted well with the white background.*

How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design? 

*I wanted the sounds for each icon to correspond with the genre each icon was representing, and more directly the aspect I was presenting visually.*

How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of concrete visual designs?

*When I think of the concept of community I think of community run programs like sports teams or public services. From here I thought of the different aspects or circumstances each of these examples would need icons, and I felt that book genres allowed for a wide range of interpretation.*

**Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment**

How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that process? 

*Started by making a test prototype to figure out how to use the program, what it was capable of etc. the actual greybox was very barebones, like the least amount of information. It was helpful as it ensured I worked on the environment simultaneously as a whole, as otherwise I think I would have focused too much on individual sections. Made it easy to visualise the divide.*

How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional media? 

*I didn't feel the actual process was that different. It was more difficult as you had to run it or export it to be able to see the finished product. More rewarding as the experience of making it is different to the end product view almost as a form of delayed gratification. Scale was something that I really struggled with. Having to run to the place of the sound to be able to test it was also annoying.*

What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?

*The camera was similar to assignment 1 in the sense that it helps to frame and provide insight into the designs. They differ as the virtual camera is interactive, and allows the player to look at and move around the design as they see fit. In comparison to the camera in AT1 which is locked in place, the ability of movement makes it harder to curate snapshots of the design.*

How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2? 

*The way I utilised sound in this project is more similar to AT1 as I used it to create atmosphere, and a more immersive experience.*

How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?

*My theme stayed relatively the same throughout, as it was symbolic it allowed for greater creative freedom in how I decided to reflect it through my environment. Probably the biggest change in theming was the addition of the fireflies at the end, initially the concept was to go from a safe environment to a fearful unknown however it felt too angsty. My solution to this was to add a more hopeful ending.*

What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have discovered otherwise?

*Many of the assets I used didn't have mesh colliders, so playtesting was integral in discovering the player could just walk through the objects in the scene. Playtesting was also helpful in figuring out scale in relation to the player, and figuring out realistic distances for sound to travel.*
