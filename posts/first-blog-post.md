The scavenger hunt around the campus was successful, we found all ten in the list

**1.An explosive cup of coffee**

We figured out that all the coffee shops had fun names and looked around for one related to blowing up. we found the sign outside the actual shop and chose to take a selfie with that rather than going inside. 

**2. A book containing Digital Media wisdom, found amongst many**

Origionally we thought that the clue was refering to a specific book in the library, however after discussing we decided it was probably just any relevent book. We also got a bit lost trying to find the way in to the second floor of the library.

**3. A wide net strug above, buldging under the weght of its flying paper cargo**

This is a net made of paper bands tied together. We didn't notice it until we got to the second floor so the selfie is through the window. 

**4. A curtain of roots, delivered by a winged visitor**

This hint was difficult to figure out, my first thought was some sort of climbing plant as seeds are often distributed by birds, but it didn't seem specific enough. Eventually though the meaning of roots to mean heritage made more sense. We did have to look up the meaning of Wurrung Biik to make the connection. 

**5. A door for the condemned**

This is a selfie of us with the door to the gallows inside the Old Melbourne Gaol, it took us a little while to decide which door made the most sense though. Another thought I had was potentially the door to first aid or something else related to being sick.

**6. A study space for a Sith Lord**

Will knew which study space this clue was referring to almost immediatly and I absolutely agreed when we walked in. The geometic shaped couches and black and white colours are very reminicent of what I've seen in those movies. 

**7. The disembodied hands of a great ape**

![ape statue](/w01s1/hands.jpeg)

This one was pretty self explanitory and easy to find. I walk past them everytime I go to class and great ape hands are pretty distinctive. 

**8. a basment dwelling Black Box, bigger than you might think**

![two of us with Black Box sign](/w01s1/blackbox.jpeg)

My first thought was a dark room, or a recording/radio studio as they could be in a basement. But ultimatly we just went to the basement of the main building and walked around until we saw this sign. 

**9. A wide machine, dispencing beverages from a far away land**

![vending machine](/w01s1/widemachine.jpeg)

This hint was obviously referring to a vending machine, but it took a while to find and identify which ones were particularly wide. The one we ended up taking the photo with dispenced a lot of asian drinks which I suppose you could say is a 'far away land'

**10. A gloden globe atop a tower of eights**

There seemed to be a lot of emphasis on the triangle corner of the map, so we decided to just go and see what was there. Its not visable in the photo but the gold globe is sitting on a row of three eights.
