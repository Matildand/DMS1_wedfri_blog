We figured out that all the coffee shops had fun names and looked around for one related to blowing up. we found the sign outside the actual shop and chose to take a selfie with that rather than going inside. 

**2. A book containing Digital Media wisdom, found amongst many**

Origionally we thought that the clue was refering to a specific book in the library, however after discussing we decided it was probably just any relevent book. We also got a bit lost trying to find the way in to the second floor of the library.

**3. A wide net strug above, buldging under the weght of its flying paper cargo**

This is a net made of paper bands tied together. We didn't notice it until we got to the second floor so the selfie is through the window.
