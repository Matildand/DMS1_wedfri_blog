**Practice Wireframing**


I chose to use pinterest to wireframe from memory, and then recreated it after checking back with the source. The first frame I made has considerably more words and lacks the unique style of the actual site. I think its still identifiable as pinterest but its clear I was missing key aspects of the website. 

**Wireframing Iterations**

I started by quickly churning out three rough ideas on how to layout the webpage, each focusing on a different style aspect.

Frame 1 has the most simple layout, i was focusing most on starting to visualise the different sections of the folio and how to seperate them. I also lent into a more collage style layout for the images.

In frame 2 I focused on organic shapes, hence the drip style layout. I felt that the sections werent seperated clearly enough and were too condensed.

Despite being in greyscale, I intended frame three to explore how I could use colour and pattern in my layout. It is probably the busiest of the three frames.

Later I combined the highlights of each of these designs and put together the fourth wireframe. It has a very clear aesthetic choice and through theme that I feel is representative of my interests and skills as a creative practitioner. I will be moving forward with this wireframe, in the image some tests I have been doing for font and designs can be seen aswell.
