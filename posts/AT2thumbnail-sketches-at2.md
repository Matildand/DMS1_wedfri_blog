**Fantasy**
The simple wand sketch is the best out of the five, it is clear in its representation of the fantasy genre. It's made up of simple geometric shapes, with the diagonal line leading the eye to the star and sparkles at the end while also enforcing the playful, energic feel. 

**Crime/Mystery**
I think the knife fits with the other icons the most as it is on the same diagonal, creating a more cohesive collection of icons.

**Graphic Novel**
The shock image works the best out of the graphic novel ideas as it is easily recognisable. Most of the other icon ideas are more niche and harder to identify for the average person.

**Classics**
The comedy and tragedy masks work the best as they are the most simple in their shapes.

**Sci-fi**
I like the ray gun icon the best as it simple, while still portraying the futuristic aesthetic through the circles. 

**Biographies**
The man on the book works the best I think as it only consists of geometric shapes, it is easy to understand what is being portrayed 

**History**
The pyramids are the clearest historical representation, and the use of only triangles allows for a geometric and therefor more analytical understanding of the non-fiction genre

**Picture Books**
The shapes on book works the best I feel because it ties in with the biography icon while also showing the simplicity of the genre.

**Children's Chapterbooks**
The crown on book is also cohesive with the biography and picture book icons, bringing the set together more.
