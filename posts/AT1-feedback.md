The biggest bit of feedback I received from the class was that the audio was too loud and the timing was a bit weird in some parts. To combat this I decided to rework the audio transition in the background music, and cut it in a different place which made it sound much more intentional. 
I also edited the sound levels, bringing the background music down to a similar level to the sound effects. 
In regards to the sound effects I also made sure that the audio lined up with the video as before the overlap made them go out of sinc. 
Overall, I neatened everything up and tried to make it more concise and contained.
