**The concept:**

The idea of becoming more independent and self sufficient, and how that might be scary or intimidating. Slowly no longer relying on what others do or provide for you. This will be represented through the presence of man made objects in a wild setting that progressively become less helpful and frequent.

**Assets**

- Trees
- House
- Campfire
- Bridge 
- Rocks 
- Pathways

**Change breakdown**

The environment will change progressivly throughout the journey to become darker and spookier. It is set in a forest, that will end up being foggier and hopefully creepier the journey progresses to represent the support of others compared to the fear and unease of being alone. I plan to also show this through the presence of man made structures like bridges and paths and houses that become older and more sporatic.
