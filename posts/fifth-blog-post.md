After creating the storyboard, I started by filming some of the easier shots first to get back into the swing of framing and composing a shot. I had some issues with a few of the birdseye veiw shots where my phone camera recorded them in portrait which caused me to have to reshoot a few things. 
The editing process in the draft is pretty simple so far, I just inserted all the shots in the correct order and did a rough edit of them to match up better with the audio track I found on the youtube audio library.
