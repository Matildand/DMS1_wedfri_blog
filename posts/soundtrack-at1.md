**Key Moment - Audio**
The key moment of my project is when the shots switch between the pencil, keyboard, and mouse. I am planning to utilise sound in this moment to enforce the emotional climax by layering the sounds of the pencil scratching and clicks of the keyboard and mouse building up until the resolution of hitting the enter button. 
The overlapping audio will provide a sense of unity between the shots, implying that they are happening simultaneously or within rapid succession.
