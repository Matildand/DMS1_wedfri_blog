**Designer Bio draft**
*Hello, my name is Matilda Anderson and I am a digital artist from Melbourne. I am currently in my first year of a bachelors in digital media at RMIT and have since explored many different mediums. I have always been drawn to colours and how they can affect audiences, which is reflected in my work.*

I really struggled writing the bio, and i am still not very happy with how it turned out. i really struggle with putting into words my skills and inetrests so it ended up being really broad.  I will probably continue to edit this before fianlising the assignment. 


In terms of visually portraying my tastes as a designer, I wanted it to have a playful, almost cutesy style with lots of colour and simple cartoonish designs. this lends itself to more organic shapes that I tend to explore in my designs  To help visualise the aesthetic I made a quick mood/aesthetic board for a rough idea of colours and designs.

I felt that the green and the nature aspect of it connected to my AT3, the simple icon style is reminist of AT2 and the pink is similar to my AT1.
